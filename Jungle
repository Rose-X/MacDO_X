In a dark room we fight, make up for our love.
I've been thinking, thinking about you, about us.
And we're moving slow, our hearts beat so fast.
I've been dreaming, dreaming about you, about us.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head, oh.

I was speaking soft, see the pain in your eyes,
I've been feeling, feeling for you, my love.
And our bodies are tired, our shadows will dance,
I've been aching, aching for you, my love.

My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head, oh.

My love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be,
hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me out of trouble,
understanding myself, understanding myself
And my love is wasted, sorry for this I never meant to be,
hurting ourselves, hurting ourselves
And I'm complicated, you won't get me out of trouble,
understanding myself, understanding myself

My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head is a jungle, jungle,
My head, oh, oh, oh, oh oh...
